SESSION STRUCTURE
================================================================================

Duration: 60 minutes
Audience: College Freshers
Prerequisites: None (explained from basics)
Technical: Requires Python 3.8+, webcam, laptop/desktop

BREAKDOWN:
- 5 min:   Hook & Introduction
- 12 min:  Core Concepts
- 4 min:   Real-World Applications
- 18 min:  LIVE DEMO (this is the highlight)
- 9 min:   Code Walkthrough
- 4 min:   Performance & Deployment
- 5 min:   Summary & Q&A

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
✅ Understand object detection and edge computing
✅ See how AI identifies objects in real-time
✅ Learn CNN architecture conceptually
✅ Build real-time detection app (15 lines of code)
✅ Know how to deploy to different devices
✅ Understand real-world applications

================================================================================
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

MINIMUM:
- Python 3.8+
- 4 GB RAM
- Webcam
- Modern CPU (Intel i5/i7, AMD equivalent)
- 100 MB disk space

RECOMMENDED:
- Python 3.9+
- 8+ GB RAM
- 2+ GHz CPU
- Good internet (for first model download ~3 MB)

WORKS ON:
✅ Windows 10/11
✅ macOS (Intel and M1/M2/M3)
✅ Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
✅ Raspberry Pi 4+ (slower performance, 5-15 FPS)

NOT NEEDED:
❌ GPU (works great on CPU)
❌ Internet (only for first setup)
❌ Special drivers
❌ Admin privileges (usually)

================================================================================
KEY METRICS
================================================================================

Model Size: 3 MB (nano version)
Download Size: 3 MB (one-time, then cached)
Inference Time: 30-50 ms per frame
Frame Rate: 20-35 FPS on CPU
Memory Usage: 300-500 MB during operation
Startup Time: 2-3 seconds (model loading)
Classes Detected: 80 different object types
Accuracy: 75-80% (nano), higher with larger models

COMPARISON:
Cloud-based:  500-2000 ms latency, requires internet
Your Laptop:   30-50 ms latency, works offline
Raspberry Pi:  50-200 ms latency, very low power

================================================================================
INSTALLATION TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

"pip not found"
→ Install Python from python.org
→ Or use: python -m pip install ...

"ModuleNotFoundError: ultralytics"
→ pip install ultralytics
→ (May need to activate virtual environment first)

"Webcam not opening"
→ Close Zoom, Teams, Discord, OBS
→ Try: python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.VideoCapture(0).isOpened())"

"Very low FPS"
→ Close background apps
→ The demo is CPU-intensive
→ This is normal—FPS varies by hardware

"Model download failed"
→ Try again (internet intermittent)
→ Or pre-download: python -c "from ultralytics import YOLO; YOLO('yolov8n.pt')"

See SETUP_AND_USAGE_GUIDE.md for comprehensive troubleshooting

================================================================================
PRESENTATION TIPS
================================================================================

BEFORE SESSION:
- Run the demo at least once
- Test your webcam
- Have a backup recorded demo
- Know your slides
- Close unnecessary applications
- Test projector/screen

DURING SESSION:
- Start with hook questions (engage immediately)
- Don't rush concepts—foundation matters
- Narrate the live demo (what you're doing)
- Make eye contact even during demo
- Have confidence (you've practiced)
- Answer questions openly

AFTER SESSION:
- Share files with students (GitHub link or download)
- Send resource links
- Offer office hours for questions
- Ask for feedback
- Celebrate their learning

See PRESENTER_GUIDE.md for detailed minute-by-minute guide

================================================================================
CUSTOMIZATION IDEAS
================================================================================

For different audiences:
- CS Students: Focus on code, architecture
- Business Students: Focus on applications, deployment
- Everyone: Live demo, real applications

For deeper engagement:
- Have them modify the code
- Let them detect their own objects
- Predict what will fail before running
- Ask them to suggest applications

For hands-on component:
- Students run minimal_demo.py themselves
- They adjust confidence threshold
- They save detected frames
- They run on different resolutions

See README.md and PRESENTER_GUIDE.md for more ideas
